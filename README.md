# Hi, I'm Joanna :wave:

Currently, actively seeking a web developer position. Lover of all the foods, chronically rewatching tv shows (peep Criminal Minds and Grey's Anatomy), reading, and all things design. If I'm not in front of the computer coding, I'm likely off in a corner doing yoga, reading or just endless twitter-scrolling.


## 🌱 I’m currently working on ...
  * learning data structures and algorithms! 
  * bettering my React knowledge. Hooks? You bet. 
  * a little side project - building a game.
  * understanding growth is not linear, and comes with time. 
  * living and learning outside of my head. 


## :coffee: Wanna Chat? 
  * @ me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joeyannax) about crime shows, your latest Netflix binge, or your book recommendations!
  * connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joannaylin/).
