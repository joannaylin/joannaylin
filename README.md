# Hey there! :sparkles: 

Hi, I'm Joanna- a front end developer actively seeking a web developer position! Lover of criminal shows, chronically rewatching Netflix shows, reading, and all things design. If I'm not in front of the computer coding, or learning, I'm likely off in a corner dancing, hiking, or just endless twitter-scrolling.


### 🌱 I’m currently working on ...
  * learning data structures and algorithms! 
  * bettering my React knowledge. Hooks? You bet. 
  * a little side project - building a game.
  * understanding growth is not linear, and comes with time. 
  * living and learning outside of my head. 


### :coffee: Wanna Chat? 
  * @ me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joeyannax) about crime shows, your latest Netflix binge, design or your book recommendations!
  * connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joannaylin/).
