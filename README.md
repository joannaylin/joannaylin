# :wave: Hi, I'm Joanna 

Currently, a software engineer at Hologram. Lover of all the foods, reading, and chronically rewatching tv shows (peep Criminal Minds and Grey's Anatomy). If I'm not in front of the computer coding, I'm likely off in a corner doing some form of aerial arts, reading or just endless twitter-scrolling. 


## 🌱 I’m currently working on ...
  * a little side project - building a game.
  * understanding growth is not linear, and comes with time. 
  * living and learning outside of my head. 


## :coffee: Wanna Chat? 
  * @ me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joeyannax) about crime shows, your latest Netflix binge, or your book recommendations!
  * connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joannaylin/).
